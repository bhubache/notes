Spirit Of C
-----------

- trust the programmer. Generally, C assumes you know what you're doing.
- don't prevent the programmer from doing what needs to be done
- keep the language small and simple
- provide only one way to do an operation
- make it fast, even if it isn't guaranteed to be portable
    - ensuring that code is portable, safe, and secure is the responsibility of the programmer

implementations == compilers

the C standard defines them as follows:
A particular set of software, running in a particular translation environment under particular control options, that
performs translation of programs for, and supports execution of programs in, a particular execution environment.
